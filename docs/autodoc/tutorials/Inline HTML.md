**Inline HTML** refers to special HTML tags that are implemented by **Vercengen**, typically as a means of styling or declaring certain behaviours. These tags are listed below in terms of cosmetic tags (which change how HTML looks) and behavioural tags (which changes how HTML behaves).

### Cosmetic Tags

- `<icon>icon_key</icon>` - Refers to a [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) icon. Its styling and colour can be changed inline.
